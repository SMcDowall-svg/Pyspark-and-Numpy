## Pyspark-and-Numpy
This is a simple data exploration project using Pyspark and Numpy.
The Jupyter notebook shows how to switch between a Numpy dataframe to a Pyspark dataframe. 

I have also included a geo visualization technique using longitude and latitude data. 


The data was sourced from Kaggle and shows Air BnB data for several locations, it includes the home dimensions and pricing information. The notebook contains some correlation analysis and data manipulation.
